# Learning

This project is a personal experiment for me. In this project I will try to learn in an open source way.

This means:

- I will track all learning materials in [issues](https://github.com/Xuanwo/Learning/issues).
- I will report my learning progress in my public project [Xuanwo's Work](https://github.com/users/Xuanwo/projects/2/views/11).
- I will commit all progress in this report every iteration (two weeks for now).
- I will write [blog](https://github.com/Xuanwo/blog) if there are any thought I think is meaningful to report.

I think it's a reproducible way of learning. Anyone with a similar background to mine can start learning incrementally with this repo. I am currently learning database system development from scratch, and I believe this project can be more or less beneficial for people who are also interested in database systems.
